# WhizBangPop's Higher Computing Jupyter Notebook Course
This project is a version of Prestick Academy's/Robert Gordons Collage, converted into self contained Jupyter Notebooks, powered by Google Colab.

The original course has been modified to learn and run within Jupyter notebooks.

Below are links to each chapter, and each exercises Google Colab link.

## Message From Creator
All of these notebooks can and will periodically change, without notice. I endeavour to keep any PowerPoints, documents, notebooks and any other resources provided as up to date as possible, but being human, this may not always be possible.
This resource is designed for educators and learners following the SQA Higher Computing Science course, but anyone can use it, and is encouraged to.
If you wish, feel free to adapt these lessons and tasks to specifics your your school/needs. Feel free to even open a pull request if you think that your changes would make a good fit for this project.
I do not want anything in return for this, apart from asking that you share this, and help more people advance their knowledge of Python and other tools used.

There may also be gaps in the course, this will most likely be due to the fact I've ran out of time. I'm just a student, not a teacher or education professional. I do not receive anything from this, nor would I expect to.

I do also have aims to expand this to the SQA National 5 & 4 courses, as well as the Advanced Higher course. But, that is currently just an idea, and I need to get the Higher one finished first. I also need to thank my computing teacher for her help with developing and creating this. She has provided immense help and wonderful suggestions to help make this applicable in a learning envrioment.

If you notice any issues with any of the notebooks, PowerPoints and/or extension material, please email me at [jupyter@sommer.anonaddy.com](mailto:jupyter@sommer.anonaddy.com) and I'll look at is ASAP.
